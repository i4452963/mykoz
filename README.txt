You now have Windows Subsystem for Linux installed with JupyterLab running as a
Linux service reachable from your browser http://localhost:8888 password is foo

- You can visit the URL directly: http://localhost:8888
- You can use the URL Icon that's been left out on your Desktop.
- You can turn it into a "stand-alone" app with Microsoft Edge.

The password is: foo

This JupyterLab installation on Windows is unlike that of other installers such
as Anaconda or JupyterLab-Desktop because it's genuinely backended by Linux and
that makes all the difference. Right now as you read this, there's a 24x7 x365
"daemon" running that you can step in and take control of using a plain Jupyter
Notebook, thus starting your Linux Wizard practice.

Of course this Linux service will "sleep" with your Laptop, but it's a 1st step.

Once you're in Jupyter, find the folder named `Intro` and run the Notebook named
`Intro.ipynb` which starts you on your Linux, Python, vim & git (LPvg) journey.

        |___/ MyKoz.AI Real/OS Tow-It-Ism: Small Portable Lifelong Linux Tech

Welcome to MyKoz.AI

You now have Windows Subsystem for Linux installed with JupyterLab running as a
Linux service, reachable from your Windows browser at http://localhost:8888

This is not like other JupyterLab installations on Windows. Yours is run by a
genuine Linux Python, meaning all the coding you do will be Linux Cloud and
local-automation ready. 

There is already a local Linux service you can immediately step in and take
control of, ready to capture screenshots on a regular basis and deposit them
into your ~/repos/whim into your folder, which you can reach Windows-side
through your normal Home location: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\repos\whim\screenshots\
